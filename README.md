# WebScraper
Simple WebScraper for a recipes website for further development...
Now index.js fetches the data from cookwell.com. In the file "all_recipes.json" i have all of the recipes from this website as well as ingredient lists, instructions and calories.
Then using shopping_list.js I'm creating a shopping list based on user chosen recipes and saving all the recipes with a list in a file called "shopping_list.txt".
